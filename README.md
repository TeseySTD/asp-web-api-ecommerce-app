# ðŸš€ Microservices Web API Project 
---
## ðŸ“‹Overview 
This is a **PET** project â€” a set of ASP.NET Core web APIs built as microservices.  
The main goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with modern architectural practices  (Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS, event-driven communication, SAGA) and libraries or frameworks (EF Core, MediatR, MassTransit, FluentValidation, etc.) . Each service follows DDD principles and is designed to be independently developed, tested and deployed.
